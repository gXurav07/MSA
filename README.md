# MSA (Medical Shop Automation)
For this project, we were asked to build a simple software called MEDICINE SHOP AUTOMATION. Its main purpose is to aid a medicine shop owner in his day to day work which involves selling medicine to customers, receiving medicine supplies from vendors, discarding expired medicines, creating proper receipts for each transaction, etc. Even though it is possible to do these works manually but the amount of time and effort that can be saved by automating these tasks is immense.  This is the main motivation behind our project.
